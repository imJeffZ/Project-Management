######## Addtional Notice about commit history ##############

In the commit history, there're some addtional git users besides our current team accounts,

But these git accounts are still owned by our team members because they sometimes work on another computer instead of their MAC and they

forgot to change the git config at other computers. 

We've sent an email to explain this condition.
